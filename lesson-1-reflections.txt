How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	A bug could only appear at the parts of the file, where something was changed.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It could help find errors and reproduce the process that finally led to a bug etc...

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You can create your commit when you think it's reasonable.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    I have no idea, sorry.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I have no idea, sorry.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can easily restore any previous versions of my code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I have absolutely no idea!
