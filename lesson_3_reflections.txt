When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    One example would surely be: If you work on several computers and you want to have all
    current files on every system.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    To be honest, i am not sure about that. Okay, GitHub enables
	multiple persons to work on one project, but in times when i 
	work alone, automatic pushing would be nice, wouldn't it? 
	One reason might be, that you eventually want to make changes to files BEFORE you push them at some state, but for that i do not have enough experience with programming.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    You add a branch to some of your existing branches if you try
	some experimental features in your code.
	When you clone something, you put the contents on your local system. Forking is like cloning on the GitHub servers but with one major difference: In contrast to cloning some users content and pushing it to your own GitHub, forking enables the original owner to see, who has 'cloned' his code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
