When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    One example would surely be: If you work on several computers and you want to have all
    current files on every system.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    To be honest, i am not sure about that. Okay, GitHub enables
	multiple persons to work on one project, but in times when i 
	work alone, automatic pushing would be nice, wouldn't it? 
	One reason might be, that you eventually want to make changes to files BEFORE you push them at some state, but for that i do not have enough experience with programming.
